# CODEWARS - Running out of space

## Details

Kevin is noticing his space run out! Write a function that removes the spaces from the values and returns an array showing the space decreasing. 

## Example

Running this function on the array ['i', 'have','no','space'] would produce ['i','ihave','ihaveno','ihavenospace'].
